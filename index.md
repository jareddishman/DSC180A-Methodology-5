Section A06, Rob Knight

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

LSTM's are new to me and very interesting. It's cool how there's so many different ways to fix the shortcomings of neural networks

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

It could be fun to investigate food additives, especially those that are not immediately apparent. It would be especially useful as there is a lot of fraud in terms of food being labeled as one thing when it is really another entirely.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would spend 1-2 fewer weeks on research/background as I think we had an operative understanding after the first couple weeks and didn't need background info as much.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would love to integrate transformers into the model. They're the hot new thing after all
